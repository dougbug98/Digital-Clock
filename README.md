# Digital-Clock
A digital clock created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
I created a user-friendly digital clock with an attractive design, title, and background image that displayed the current time on a website. I used JavaScript to retrieve the current time from the computer and displayed it digitally. The clock was synchronized with my computer's time, ensuring that it always displayed the correct time. This assignment helped me acquire valuable skills, such as working with JavaScript to retrieve the current time and designing a visually appealing website.
